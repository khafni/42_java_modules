## General Rules

- Use the latest LTS version of Java.
- Both JVM and GraalVM can be used to run your code.
- Recommended IDE is IntelliJ IDEA.
- Follow the Oracle standards for code formatting.
- Make sure to organize your code in a Git repository.
- Do not leave unnecessary files in your directory.
- Avoid precalculated output; solve the exercises correctly.
- Seek help from peers and online resources.
- Pay attention to examples for exercise-specific requirements.
- Use `System.out` for output.

## Rules of the Day

- Avoid user-defined methods and classes except for static functions in the main class file.
- System::exit can be used for all exercises.
- Follow the allowed language constructs for each exercise.
- Compare your output with the provided examples.

## Exercise 00: Sum of Digits

- Calculate the sum of digits of a six-digit int number.
- Example: `java Program` for the input `479598` should output `42`.
- Restrictions: Use only primitive types and standard operations.

## Exercise 01: Really Prime Number

- Determine if an input number is prime.
- Display the result and the number of steps required.
- Example: `java Program` for the input `169` should output `false 12`.
- Restrictions: Use primitive types, conditions, and loops.

## Exercise 02: Endless Sequence (or not?)

- Count queries related to coffee preparation based on a specific condition.
- Example: `java Program` for a set of numbers should count and display results.
- Restrictions: Use primitive types, conditions, and loops.

## Exercise 03: A Little Bit of Statistics

- Visualize student progress with a chart.
- Example: `java Program` to create a chart based on student grades and attendance.
- Restrictions: Use primitive types, strings, conditions, and loops.

## Exercise 04: A Bit More of Statistics

- Count character occurrences in a text and display a histogram.
- Example: `java Program` for an input text should count and display the most frequent characters.
- Restrictions: Use primitive types, strings, arrays, conditions, and loops.

## Exercise 05: Schedule

- Maintain a class timetable with student attendance records.
- Example: `java Program` to create a timetable, record attendance, and display it.
- Restrictions: Use primitive types, strings, arrays, conditions, and loops.
